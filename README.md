**#Problem statement:**
     Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan. Upon receiving the loan application, the company need to validate the customer eligibility for loan. Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer details provided while filling online application form.
**#My Task:**
   To predict the loan status for each observation in the test set.
**#Overview of the solution:**
            1)Fill the continuous null values by the median of their attribute and the discrete null values by random choice of probabilities.
            2)Detect the ouliers and found the most outliers by IQR method.
            3)Perform EDA to understand the relationship between the target variable and features.
            4)Perform feature engineering to choose the best feature for the model.
            5)Build three models(Logistic Regression,Decision Tree,Random Forest).
            6)Based on model's accuracy and performance chose the best model model and fitted it on test dataset to predict the result.
